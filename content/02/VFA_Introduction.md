## Variable Flip Angle T<sub>1</sub> Mapping

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Variable flip angle (VFA) T<sub>1</sub> mapping (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977; Fram et al. 1987), also known as Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T<sub>1</sub> (DESPOT1) (Homer & Beevers 1985; Deoni et al. 2003), is a rapid quantitative T<sub>1</sub> measurement technique that is widely used to acquire 3D T<sub>1</sub> maps (e.g. whole-brain) in a clinically feasible time. VFA estimates T<sub>1</sub> values by acquiring multiple spoiled gradient echo acquisitions, each with different excitation flip angles (<i>θ<sub>n</sub></i> for n = 1, 2, .., N and <i>θ<sub>i</sub></i> ≠ <i>θ<sub>j</sub></i>). The steady-state signal of this pulse sequence (Figure 1) uses very short TRs (on the order of magnitude of 10 ms) and is very sensitive to T<sub>1</sub> for a wide range of flip angles.

VFA is a technique that originates from the NMR field, and was adopted because of its time efficiency and the ability to acquire accurate T<sub>1</sub> values simultaneously for a wide range of values (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977). For imaging applications, VFA also benefits from an increase in SNR because it can be acquired using a 3D acquisition instead of multislice, which also helps to reduce slice profile effects. One important drawback of VFA for T<sub>1</sub> mapping is that the signal is very sensitive to inaccuracies in the flip angle value, thus impacting the T<sub>1</sub> estimates.  In practice, the nominal flip angle (i.e. the value set at the scanner) is different than the actual flip angle experienced by the spins (e.g. at 3.0 T, variations of up to ±30%), an issue that increases with field strength. VFA typically requires the acquisition of another quantitative map, the transmit RF amplitude (B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>, or B<sub>1</sub> for short), to calibrate the nominal flip angle to its actual value because of B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneities that occur in most loaded MRI coils (Sled & Pike 1998). The need to acquire an additional B<sub>1</sub> map reduces the time savings offered by VFA over saturation-recovery techniques, and inaccuracies/imprecisions of the B<sub>1</sub> map are also propagated into the VFA T<sub>1</sub> map (Boudreau et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017).
